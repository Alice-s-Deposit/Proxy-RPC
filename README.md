**Privacy is not an option**

In an increasingly interconnected Blockchain ecosystem, it has become challenging to disentangle your on-chain activity from your identity. To avoid being associated with a specific address or transaction, we need the capability to interact with the blockchain privately. Here is the solution we have developed to solve this issue.

####

## **Features** ✨

-  A fully private and decentralized RPC caller 🌐
- API caller built on [bacalhau](https://www.bacalhau.org/) <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FTNDJSrXwAE8jCz.jpg" width="20" height="20">
- Private RPCs based on the [Hopr network](https://hoprnet.org/)   <img src="https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/200x200/6520.png"  height="20">

## **The concept** 💡
When a user wants to withdraw funds from a centralized exchange, they can use our solution to ensure that their final receiving address is not linked to their physical identity. However, as soon as they use a public RPC (Remote Procedure Call), their address will be identified as belonging to them. This is where our proxy comes in handy: it makes the RPC call private using a container on bacalhau and hopr.

## **The team** 🏆

**The team consists of 4 committed people who love what they do.**

We are all students bound by our passion and commitment for blockchain and Web3. We want to develop innovative solutions that will help the whole ecosystem expand. Too many times have we seen privacy being set aside in projects and we want to be able to change that. That is why Maxime, Nathan, Thomas and Adam are glad to present Alice’s Deposit, the solution for real privacy.

By addressing the need for privacy in the blockchain ecosystem while having a real utility in our daily life, Alice's Deposit has the potential to be a valuable tool for individuals and businesses alike.
